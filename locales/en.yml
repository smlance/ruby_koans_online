    explanation: >
      Each page consists of a number of tests that you have to complete and any information you
      might require to help you make those test pass.  You can run the tests by clicking the
      Meditate button at any time or by pressing the Enter key when filling in any of the tests.

      red-explanation: write a failing test and run it,
      green-explanation: write just enough code to make the test pass, and
      refactor-explanation: look at the code to see if you can make it any better.

      red-explanation: >
        the tests will start in the failing state (background is <span class="green">green</span>)
      green-explanation: >
        type what you expect the result(s) to be in the input box(es) provided to make the test pass (
        background becomes <span class="green">green</span>)
      refactor-explanation: >
        then take a moment to reflect upon the test to see what it is teaching you and, if required,
        improve the code to better communicate its intent (<span class="refactor">refactor</span>)

      explanation: >
        If the results were not what you expected, the Koans will guide you back to the enlightened path with a hint.
        <br/>
        Type <i>false</i> in the box below to see the hint displayed.
      question: <em>Wait, but it said it expected <u>false</u>! What gives!?</em>
      answer: >
        The wording comes from the TestUnit framework.<br/>
        In TDD you will write a test with an expectation of how you want the code to behave
        and then write the actual code to make that test pass.<br/>
        <br/>
        This might seem confusing in the case of the Ruby Koans, where most of the test is usually written for you.<br/>
        In Koans you are providing what <em>your</em> expectation is, so the test framework reports <em>your</em> expectations vs actual results.

  world:
    title: The Koans World
    explantion: >
      The koans are broken out into areas covering such topics as hashes, modules and classes.
      Each of these are presented on their own page.
      Each koan builds up your knowledge of Ruby and builds upon itself.
