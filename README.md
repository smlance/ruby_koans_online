## Development Setup

### Ruby Dependencies

The koans currently run on ree 1.8.7. Ruby gem dependencies are handled by [bundler](http://gembulder.com). To install all the necessary gems, run `bundle install`.

### Node.js Dependencies

Dependecies are handled by [npm](http://npmjs.org/). Ruby Koans Online is tested using [zombie.js](http://zombie.labnotes.org/). To install all the necessary packages, run `npm install`.

### Development

To start the development server, run `rackup` and point your browser to `localhost:9292`

Alternatively, you could use `rerun`. This reloads the app for you when changes are detected. Use the command:

`rerun -p "**.*.{rb,ru,haml,css,js,yml}" rackup`

#### Running the tests:

1. Start the app using `rackup`. Ensure it's running on port `9292` (the default).
2. Run `node suite.js`.
